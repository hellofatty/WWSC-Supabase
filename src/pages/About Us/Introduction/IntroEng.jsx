                The Wiser sport originated as the most prestigious ball sport played in ancient palaces and royal courts
                by emperors, kings, ministers, scholar-officials and Western heads of state in order to cultivate the
                ability to strategize, exercise the body, and engage in a battle of wits. Unfortunately, with the
                passage of time, this diversion enjoyed worldwide by emperors, kings, and prime ministers has long since
                become a lost sport.

                However, a magnificent, selfless, elder virtuous one has now rediscovered and perfected the Wiser sport
                for the benefit of the public. This elder virtuous one is the one of noble moral character. In its 112

                , which commended the elder virtuous one for the contributions he has made to humanity. When the elder
                virtuous one taught all of the techniques and rules of the Wiser sport to World Wiser Sport Committee,
                he solemnly stated, “
                <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>
                    You must spread the Wiser sport all over the world and become the headquarters that leads the Wiser

                    Wiser. That is because Wiser is purely a ball sport that nature has bestowed upon humanity to
                    strengthen the body and improve health. Everyone has the equal right to enjoy it. Its only purpose
                    is to benefit humanity through strengthening the body, improving health, elevating morality,
                    increasing friendship, and promoting peace in the world.

                The World Wiser Sport Committee has now been formally established, with its headquarters located in the

                    The inauguration ceremony for installing the World Wiser Sport Committee’s first-term leadership was
                    held in the United States on March 2, 2013.

            <ResParagraph>
                Wiser is a ball sport in which strategy and exercise are combined, and motion and stillness vie with
                each other, all in a setting where teams compete against each other. A special playing field is not
                required. It can be played in any area, no matter how many obstacles there may be. It is extremely safe
                and suitable for everyone—male, female, old, and young can play it.
            </ResParagraph>

            <ResParagraph>
                It is an unfortunate fact that some elderly people are not in good health. They may even suffer from
                limb numbness, which makes it difficult for them to walk. Some have cognitive and memory issues that can
                impair their ability to function in life. Yet, as long as elderly people are able to play Wiser, the
                Wiser sport can help them improve their immunity, strengthen their body, enhance their stamina, enliven
                exhausted brain cells, avoid senile dementia, broaden and ease their mind, increase their happiness,
                prevent rheumatism and chilliness, and avoid loneliness, insomnia, and numbness of the limbs.
            </ResParagraph>

            <ResParagraph>
                Middle-aged and young people can likewise reap these benefits. Through playing Wiser, they can enhance
                their wisdom and develop their mental vitality. In addition, playing Wiser can resolve the tendency of
                homebound men and women to be solitary, eccentric, and asocial. That is because involvement in Wiser
                will provide them with opportunities to go outdoors, make friends during matches, increase their
                self-confidence, and develop wholesome social relations.
            </ResParagraph>

            <ResParagraph>
                Moreover, teenagers and children who play Wiser will become better at thinking independently and will be
                more courteous and virtuous. They will develop tenacity, physical strength, and intelligence. It is the
                best sport for rearing people of talent.
            </ResParagraph>

            <ResParagraph>
                In short, playing the Wiser sport not only builds physical strength, but also develops wisdom and
                brainpower. It does not matter if the player is old, middle-aged, young, a teenager, a child, male, or
                female. No special playing field is required. An appropriate playing field could be set up based on the
                conditions that exist at the particular site. Different types of playing fields and various irregularly
                shaped obstacles are not only part of the setting of the sport, but they even provide the key to opening
                wisdom. Clever planning and intelligence spring from the minds of players as myriad changes take place
                during the course of a game. Variations in playing fields and changes in obstacles add new challenges
                for the players. Even if one plays at the same playing field all the time, since each match is unique in
                terms of its sequence, line, direction, and strength of attacks initiated by members of one’s own team
                and the other team, there is never any repetition among different matches. Each match requires the
                application of different layout and attack techniques. All of this enables players to improve their
                wisdom, sharpen their sport skills, and experience the delight of extraordinary variety. This is a
                characteristic of Wiser that all other ball sports lack. A congratulation letter to the World Wiser
                Sport Committee from the International Olympic Committee and the International Boxing Association
                enthusiastically praised the Wiser sport as “the most ideal sport of all the ball sports.”
            </ResParagraph>

            <ResParagraph>
                Moreover, playing the Wiser sport is extremely safe. Anyone who likes to exercise, wants to strengthen
                both body and mind, and wants to build moral character can play this sport. It is a sport that truly
                treats everyone equally. It entails both individual and group strategies and tactics. From the
                perspective of developing one's intelligence and thought processes, the Wiser sport is like organizing
                battle formations in war or playing chess. From the perspective of exercising the body and increasing
                one’s physical strength, it is a perfect, natural, engaging ball sport. Thus, Wiser is the perfect ball
                sport for athletes and non-athletes worldwide.
            </ResParagraph>

            <ResParagraph>
                Generally speaking, Wiser has the following seven types of beneficial effects: strengthening the body
                and improving health, enlivening the spirit, developing brainpower and wisdom, increasing unity and
                friendliness, improving the body's immunity, delaying the decline of stamina, and helping to elevate
                moral character. Experience has shown that everyone who has played the Wiser ball game praises it and
                wants to keep playing it, for it has clearly given them a healthier body and mind.
