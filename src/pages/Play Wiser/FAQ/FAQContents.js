                    When holding official Wiser ball competitions, program arrangement and the number of participating
                    Wiser sport teams may impose additional demands on the hosting Wiser sport organizations. Without
                    specifically defining and limiting the time duration of each competition game, the hosting
                    organization is often faced with the difficulty of being unable to finish all the games within the
                    program schedule. Therefore, in response to the need of limiting the time of competition games, the
                    World Wiser Sport Committee has now specifically made the following unified provisions as the
                    corresponding revisions to the original rules: If game time needs to be limited and defined, the
                    time duration of a Wiser game for team competition with 7 players on each team will be uniformly
                    defined as 90 minutes (one and a half hours). Additionally, the time duration of a Wiser game for
                    single or double competitions will be defined as 60 minutes (1 hour).

                    In response to the need of defining the range of Wiser competition field when holding official Wiser
                    ball competitions by Wiser sport organizations, the World Wiser Sport Committee has specifically
                    established the following standard range of playing field for official Wiser competitions: the
                    length must be in a range between 30 meters and 43 meters, and the width cannot be greater than its
                    length.

                    According to the definition of out of bounds, the entire ball must be completely outside of the

                    outer boundary line. Therefore, a ball partially on the outer boundary line cannot be ruled out of
                    bounds. (For details please see the definition of Out of Bounds.)

                    The ruling of an Out of Bounds must be based on the ball’s first point of landing when the ball
                    touched any obstacle or the ground outside the outer boundary line, not on the ball’s final point of
                    landing. Therefore, as long as the ball’s first point of landing meets the definition of out of
                    bounds, it will be ruled as out of bounds. (For details please see the definition of Out of Bounds.)

                    Prior to each serve, each team has a 20-second time limit for discussion. The officiating referee is
                    responsible for announcing and monitoring each 20-second discussion time limit. The duration of each
                    20-second time limit includes team’s discussing and deciding which player serves, until the
                    designated serving player picks up the ball after the referee blows the whistle. If no player from
                    the serving team picks up the ball after the 20-second time limit has expired, the serving team will
                    be ruled as committing a foul. Additionally, the serving player has to launch the ball out within 10
                    seconds after picking up the ball. Otherwise, a foul will also be ruled.

                <ResParagraphNoIndent>
                    According to the rules of ball serving, there is no restriction in direction, path, or distance when
                    serving balls as long as the ball is served within the defined Wiser competition field (i.e., within
                    the outer boundary line). If a ball is out-of-bounds, the player serving the ball will be ruled as
                    committing a foul.<br></br>
                    During the ball serving phase, each team has an exemption from penalty when the first foul is
                    committed. For example, when serving balls, the first occurrence of serving the ball outside of the
                    outer boundary line will not result in a penalty, but the player who serves the ball out must take
                    the ball back to serve again.<br></br>
                    However, after that, when any player serves the ball out of boundary or commits any serving fouls, a
                    corresponding penalty will be imposed. The specific penalty for serving out is that the player will
                    take the ball back and put it at its original position at the service line and will not be allowed
                    to serve again. Only until after all other players of both teams have finished serving and the game
                    contesting phase has started, a team with any players who have not served due to committing fouls
                    must serve their balls first before the team can attack.

                    According to the revised rules in this Competition Rules Handbook, when serving balls, if the ball

                    ruled as committing a foul. The serving is still valid and can be considered as a kind of effective
                    strategy. If the ball being hit stops inside the range of the playing field and is not out-of-bounds
                    after the hit, it will stay where it is and won’t need to be placed back to its original position
                    before being hit. However, if the ball being hit goes outside the outer boundary line, then it will
                    need to be placed back to its original position before being hit.

                    interception, the referee, to make the contest fair, has the authority to judge from the actual

                    setting” and had the obvious intention to attack. If so, the referee can issue a warning upon the
                    first occurrence of such a situation! If the team has repeated actions of this type, the referee can
                    rule that the player doing so has committed a foul.

                    The rule is each hit of the opponent’s ball rescues one ball at a time that was hit and locked by it
                    and the ball that got hit and locked by the opponent’s ball first will be rescued first. To rescue
                    the balls of our team that were locked by an opponent’s ball, the order of rescuing is determined by
                    the chronological order of the balls being hit. Suppose that Red 5 has hit and locked White 4 first
                    and later hit White 7. Later in the game, if Red 5 was hit by White 3, the hit on Red 5 could only
                    be used to rescue White 4 first and could not rescue both White 4 and White 7 all at once. Only
                    until Red 5 was hit again by any White ball can White 7 then be rescued. This is because hitting the
                    opponent’s ball once can only be used to rescue one ball at a time.

                    <br />
                    (2) If this ball of Team A that got hit did not lock any ball of Team B, the hit it got can then be
                    used to rescue the ball of team B that was locked by another ball of team A which has been struck
                    out from the game. (Please see Question 13)
                    <br />
                    (3) If all locked balls mentioned in (1) and (2) above have been rescued, the hit on that ball of
                    Team A can then be used to rescue the ball of Team B that was locked due to a “Mishit.” (Please see
