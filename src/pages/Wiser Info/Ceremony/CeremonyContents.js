                The World Wiser Sport Committee, headquartered in the United States, is the flagship organization for
                the Wiser sport worldwide. It held its first inaugural ceremony on the afternoon of March 2nd, 2013, at
                its headquarters in Covina, California. Leaders of national, provincial and state Wiser sport
                organizations attended the large-scale gathering. They came from more than ten countries and regions,
                such as the United States, Canada, China, Thailand, Vietnam, South Africa, Paraguay, Malaysia, Taiwan,
                and Hong Kong. The mayor of Covina city and some diplomatic envoys and honored guests also came to view
                the ceremony and extend their congratulations.

                The Wiser sport originated as the highest-class ball sport played in ancient palaces and royal courts by
                emperors, kings, ministers, scholar-officials and Western heads of state in order to exercise the body,
                cultivate the ability to strategize, and have a battle of wits. Unfortunately, after the passage of a
                long period of time, it became a lost sport. However, a magnificent, selfless, elder virtuous one has
                now rediscovered and perfected the Wiser sport for the benefit of the public. This elder virtuous one
                has a noble moral character. In the 112<sup>th</sup> Congress, the United States Senate passed through
                unanimous consent{" "}

                    resolution 614
                </a>
                , which commended this elder virtuous one for the contributions he has made to humanity.
             </ResParagraph>
             <ResParagraph>
                This elder virtuous one taught all of the techniques and rules of the Wiser sport to the World Wiser
                Sport Committee without receiving any compensation. At that time, he solemnly stated, “I transmitted all
                the techniques of the Wiser sport to you. There are two things that need to be declared. First, you must
                not disclose my name to the public; secondly, you must spread the Wiser sport all over the world and
                become the headquarters that leads the Wiser sport. Remember, I must state that the Wiser sport does not
                belong to Buddhism. It is not a sport that belongs to any particular religion. No matter what one’s
                religion may be, no matter if one has no religion, no matter if one is male or female, old or young,
                everyone has the right to enjoy and be part of this sport. That is because Wiser is purely a ball sport
                that nature has bestowed upon humanity to strengthen the body and improve health. It is completely
                unconnected with race, ethnicity, or religion. Everyone has an equal right to enjoy it. Its only purpose
                is to benefit humanity through strengthening the body, improving health, elevating morality, increasing
                friendship, and promoting peace in the world.”
             </ResParagraph>
             <ResParagraph>
                During the inaugural ceremony on March 2nd, committee members and supervisors unanimously selected Vic
                Yee to take office as the President of World Wiser Sport Committee. Vic Yee, as President, then
                conferred insignia upon Vice-Presidents Gregory Noble, Jessie Hu, and Pengzhi Qi, Secretary-General
                Vince Huang, committee members Ming Yu Huang, Steven Meyers, and Ding Mar, and Deputy
                Secretaries-General Amy Roiland, Michael Lin, and Joe Hong. He also conferred insignia upon leaders of
                Wiser sport organizations in various countries. Each insignia corresponded to the respective offices
                that were assumed. Moreover, Vic Yee urged workers at every level to strive to spread the Wiser sport
                all over the world so that all of humanity could enjoy the benefits of this sport.
             </ResParagraph>
             <ResParagraph>
                Because the Wiser sport originated in ancient palaces and royal courts, it is a noble sport of gentlemen
                and ladies. As such, it does not have the casual nature of other ball sports. That is why a dignified
                appearance and dignified attire are very important. Without those, the noble and elegant spirit of the
                Wiser sport will be lost. We hope that all players attending in formal national or international Wiser
                sport tournaments can wear the Wiser uniforms specified by the World Wiser Sport Committee. However,
                World Wiser Sport Committee has not required players to wear the uniform when practicing Wiser ball or
                when playing general Wiser ball matches. At such times, players can wear whatever clothing they like.
             </ResParagraph>
             <ResParagraph>
                At the inaugural ceremony, many players of the Wiser sport wore such standard uniforms. They looked
                orderly, neat, and full of energy. The male players had a dignified, handsome bearing, and the female
                players had a noble, elegant, glowing appearance that conveyed youthful vigor.
             </ResParagraph>
             <ResParagraph>
                Wiser is a ball sport in which strategy and exercise are combined, and motion and stillness vie with
                each other, all in a setting where teams compete against each other. Playing the Wiser sport not only
                builds physical strength, but it also develops wisdom and brain power. It does not matter if the player
                is old, middle-aged, young, a teenager, a child, male, female, tall, short, obese, or thin. It does not
                matter what the player’s ethnicity or race is. A special playing field is not required. Different types
                of playing fields and various irregularly shaped obstacles are not only part of the overall setting of
                the sport, but they also provide the key to attaining wisdom. Clever planning and intelligence spring
                from the minds of players as myriad changes take place during the course of a game. All of this enables
                players to constantly enrich their minds, improve their wisdom, and experience the delight of
                extraordinary variety. These are the characteristics of Wiser that all other ball sports lack.
             </ResParagraph>
             <ResParagraph>
                Moreover, playing the Wiser sport is extremely safe. It entails both individual and group strategies and
                tactics. From the perspective of developing one's intelligence and thought processes, the Wiser sport is
                like forming battle formations in war or the playing of chess. From the perspective of exercising the
                body and increasing one’s physical strength, it is a perfect, natural, high-class ball sport. Dr.
                Ching-Kuo Wu, a member of the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board and President of the
                International Boxing Association, highly praised the Wiser sport in a letter he wrote on behalf of the
                International Olympic Committee and the International Boxing Association congratulating the World Wiser
                Sport Committee. He wrote, “Wiser is thus the most ideal sport of all the ball sports.”

             <ResParagraph>
